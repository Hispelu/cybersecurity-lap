# SOC Role & Blue Team Operations – Learning Notes

**Platform:** TryHackMe  
**Track:** SOC / Blue Team  
**Level:** Beginner  
**Focus Area:** SOC Structure & Incident Response Workflow
## Personal Reflection

This module significantly improved my understanding of how Security Operations Centers (SOC) function within an organization and how different security roles collaborate to protect business assets.

I gained clarity on the escalation workflow from SOC Level 1 analysts to Level 2 analysts and Incident Response teams, and I now understand how responsibilities shift based on incident severity. Learning the distinction between SOC, MSSP, and specialized teams such as CIRT/CSIRT helped me appreciate the operational and strategic layers of cybersecurity defense.

This lesson also reinforced the importance of thinking like an attacker, validating alerts before escalation, and continuously improving detection rules based on previous incidents. I now better understand how technical roles (SOC analysts, engineers) and governance roles (CISO, GRC specialists) align to create a structured and resilient security framework.

Overall, this module strengthened my interest in the SOC career path and highlighted the foundational skills required to grow into more advanced defensive security roles.
